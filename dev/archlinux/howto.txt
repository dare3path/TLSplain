(untested steps, but should give u an idea)

$ mkdir ~/SOURCE
$ cd ~/SOURCE
$ git clone https://gitlab.archlinux.org/archlinux/packaging/packages/openssl.git

that created ./openssl/ dir
so ~/SOURCE/openssl/ is the arch_dir= in ./demo/env.sh in this TLSPlain repo. (you'll want to update env.sh if this path is different)

this whole thing was tested on this archlinux openssl package commit:
commit 84b208fde5438cfda9383c54272c57ee31fdf2a4 (HEAD -> main, tag: 3.5.0-1, origin/main, origin/HEAD)

$ cd openssl
$ git checkout 84b208fde5438cfda9383c54272c57ee31fdf2a4

now copy all files/dirs from repo dir's current dir ./openssl.repo/* into your ~/SOURCE/openssl/ dir.

$ patch -p1 -i ./arch.diff

that patched the PKGBUILD

make sure the PKGBUILD refers to this TLSplain patch so that the below ./go_first_time_extract_and_prep command will auto-apply it, or you can apply it manually later then if you ensure PKGBUILD doesn't fail.

$ ./go_first_time_extract_and_prep

this makes ./src/openssl-3.4.1/ dir and all source is prepare() there too.


to compile or recompile do:
$ ./go

then run a server from repo's demo dir
then run a client from there too, and see the error differences.
